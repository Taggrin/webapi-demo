# Web API Demo

Demo of a Web API with basic CRUD operations with endpoints protected by OAuth2.

Normally you would use a legit account for authentication. For this demo you can access as follows:
```/auth/token``` with username ```admin``` and password ```admin```. To be able to read you need the ```product.read``` scope, and to write the ```product.write``` scope.

Launching the project starts you at the ```/swagger``` documentation to allow easy testing.
